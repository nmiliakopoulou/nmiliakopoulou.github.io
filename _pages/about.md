I'm a third year PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Josep Torrellas](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/josep/torrellas.html).  I am a member of the [i-acoma group](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/), where I focus on designing efficient systems and architectures for emerging machine learning workloads in the cloud. My research interests lie in computer architecture, systems, and machine learning, with an emphasis on optimizing performance and resource efficiency for large-scale ML inference.

I am honored to be a recipient of the 2025 [Amazon AICE PhD Fellowship](https://www.amazon.science/news-and-features/amazon-launches-the-aice-center-at-the-university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign), awarded for my research on optimizing ML systems and architectures for large-scale cloud environments.

This summer (2025), I will be interning with the [Azure Research Systems](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/azure-research-systems/) group at Microsoft, working on designing efficient LLM inference systems. Previously, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with leading industry research groups:

<ul>
<li>
Summer 2024 – Interned with the Network Research Group at NVIDIA, where I characterized microarchitectural bottlenecks in LLM workloads.
</li>

<li>
Summer 2023 – Interned with the Hybrid Cloud group at IBM Research, focusing on improving the memory efficiency of Ray-based environments for ML serving systems.
</li>
</ul>

Through these experiences, I have gained hands-on expertise in LLM optimization, cloud-scale ML serving, memory systems, and hardware-software co-design, aiming to bridge the gap between ML workloads and modern computing infrastructures.
